  <h2> What is CSS?</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
      <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be dispalyed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
      <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">CSS is not necessary </span><span class="spanback"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
      <li class="underlinig">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
      <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
      <li>External - by using a link element to link an external CSS file</li>
      <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the syles in external CSS files. However,<span class="spanback"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li> 
     </ul>
  <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
  <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elemnts on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
  <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class ans ID. Both are used to target elements to which style should be applied.</p>
